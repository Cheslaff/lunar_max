## Why?
"Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?"<br>
Long story short, I decided to brush up on my ML knowledge because working with deep neural networks and complex architectures was taking me out of touch with reality.
I checked out the LUNA-R project (which I'm really proud of)
and realized that some parts of it were, if not wrong, then questionable.
I built a few models in the KurwAI archive tutorial and decided to take the CS229 course to get a good refresher course.
After I made that decision, I also felt like I wanted to implement LUNA-R again with better solutions. That's it.

## Postscript
I plan to rewrite code, so if you want to see original project code (for what reason dude), check out Venchislav/LUNA-R or "/legacy" branch of this repository<br>
Peace!
